# Interactive-Graphics-LineGraph

#### My second graph is the line graph, that shows the attendance percentage of female and male over 13 weeks i.e., from start of a semester to the end, where x-axis represents weeks and y-axis represents attendance percentage.

1. A tooltip is introduced to display the gender, week, day and percentage to the user when a mouse is pointed on any of the dots.
2. A curtain/guideline is introduced at top right of the graph, when enabled shows the future trends of the data.
3. Blue line represents female attendance percentages and orange for males.

â€œNote: A trend that can be observed from this graph is, at the start of semester attendance percentages are at peak, which gradually decreases as the week passes and at the last week or at the end of semester ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60353999/157784024-5e5ec8c6-f657-4ecc-b02a-af84ee5e3929.png)
